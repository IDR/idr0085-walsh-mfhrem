Study Description	Multi-fluorescent High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (MF-HREM) is a serial-sectioning, block-facing, wide-field fluorescence technique. It can image large volumes (>0.5mm3) at high resolution (~2um) without the need for tissue clearing or optical sectioning. We detail developments in sample processing including stain penetration, resin embedding and imaging. In addition, we describe image post-processing methods needed to segment and further quantify these data. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of MF-HREM by: 1) quantifying adult mouse glomeruli. 2) identifying injected cells and vascular networks in tumour xenograft models; 3) quantifying vascular networks and white matter track orientation in mouse brain.

Protocol Description	For tumour xenograft model cells from the FaDu human breast cancer cell line were cultured in complete medium (Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium Eagle with L-glutamine (DMEM) (Lonza)+10% fetal  bovine serum (Invitrogen)) in the ratio 1:10 (vol/vol) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2.	Tumour cells were stained with CMDiI prior to innoculation.	In all cases vasculature was stained via tail vein i.v. with Dyelight649 conjugated to tomato Lectin (Vector), brain white matter was stained ex vivo by immersion in CMDiI, Cell nuceli were stained ex vivo by immersion in HCS CellMask.	Kidney glomeruil were segmented via gradient vector flow algorithm, deconvolution of datasets was performed using Richardonson-lucy algorithm, iterations and PSF details given for each image set.
